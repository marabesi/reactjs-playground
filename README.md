# reactjs-playground

This is a simple ReactJS playground project to experiment with React components and features. Along the years
it has evolved to include various examples and demos of React concepts, such as hooks, state management, routing, and more.
Recently, nextjs has been added to explore server-side rendering and static site generation with React.
